# Welcome to my Srh-University-Furth Repository

This repository contains a curated (non-exhaustive) collection of academic and applied projects completed during my time at SRH University.  
The projects span multiple domains and demonstrate my approach to analysis, problem-solving, and structured project work in an academic setting.

## Contents

The repository includes selected coursework, case studies, and independent projects. Please note that this is not a complete archive of all work undertaken during my studies.

Certain projects, most notably an analysis of a Great Place to Work® survey, are not included in this repository due to NDA and confidentiality constraints.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to:

- Showcase project structure, methodology, and analytical thinking

- Provide insight into my academic and practical experience

- Serve as a reference for reviewers, collaborators, or prospective employers

## Usage Notes

The materials are provided for review and reference purposes only.

Any proprietary frameworks, datasets, or client-sensitive information have been intentionally excluded.

## Contact

If you have any questions about the projects, methodologies used, or would like further context on any work that is not publicly available, please feel free to reach out.

Thank you for taking the time to explore this repository.
